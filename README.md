# Live Web Editor
Live Web Editor is a simple project that seeks to provide a simple and practical tool to all those who find themselves learning the basic languages of web technologies `(HTML, CSS and JS)`.
Its use is simple, since with each key that we press in the editor, it will be executed instantly by the real-time viewer that is integrated in the application. This except for the `JavaScript editor block`, which is executed once the `[Enter]` key is pressed. This in order to have more comfort when executing the `scripts`, since it would be very annoying if letter by letter were to run executing the entered code. Different case for `HTML` and` CSS` that does need to be executed instantly on each code letter we write.
