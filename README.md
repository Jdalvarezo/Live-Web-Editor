# Live Web Editor
Live Web Editor is a project that offers a simple, fast and practical tool to all those who develop in/or are learning the basic languages of web technologies `(HTML, CSS and JS)`.
Its use is simple, since with each key that we press in the editor, it will be instantly executed by the real-time viewer that is integrated into the application.
It also contains an export menu both to `multiple files` and to a `single file`, along with the option to quickly start a code from scratch.
